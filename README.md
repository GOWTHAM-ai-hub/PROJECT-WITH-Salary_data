# PROJECT-WITH-Salary_data
ðŸ”¹ Project Description

Objective: Predict an employeeâ€™s salary based on their years of experience (or other factors, if available).

Techniques used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking distributions, correlations, and trends.

Visualization: Scatter plots of experience vs salary.

Modeling: Applying regression (often Simple Linear Regression first).

Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

ðŸ”¹ Example Steps

Load the data (CSV or Excel).

Explore â€“ check summary stats, missing values.

Visualize â€“ plot experience vs salary.

Build model â€“ fit a regression line.

Predict â€“ input a value (e.g., 5 years experience) and get salary estimate.

Evaluate â€“ see how well the model predicts unseen data.

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases

HR analytics (estimating fair pay).

Salary forecasting.

Beginner-level ML demonstration.
